- allow multiple selections and operations on them (close all, save all etc.)

- click on a table header and sort by this column:
  is currently not feasible, because jEdit sorts buffers in a different way
  internally, and we have no means to modify this sort order. If then we cycle
  through the buffers with 'next-buffer'/'previous-buffer', the current
  highlighted buffer would jump around in an inintuitive way in BufferList.
